### About the Experiment 

The objective of the "Logistic Population Growth: Continuous and Discrete" experiment is to explore and compare the principles of logistic growth models in both continuous and discrete time frameworks. Through this experiment, students will understand the dynamics of population growth under limited resources, as modeled by the logistic equation. By analyzing the population size over time using both continuous and discrete approaches, learners will gain insights into the concept of carrying capacity and the effects of population density on growth rates. The experiment aims to provide a hands-on understanding of how the logistic model can be applied in real-world scenarios to predict population behavior and the impact of environmental constraints.
